CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findolympic_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "olympic_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "olympic_interfaces" with any of the following names:

    olympic_interfacesConfig.cmake
    olympic_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "olympic_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "olympic_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "olympic_interfaces" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
